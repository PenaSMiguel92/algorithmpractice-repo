     * A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
     * Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. 
     * If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
     * You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. 
     * In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
     * You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
     * 
     * Example: 
     * Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
     * Output: 2
     * 
     * Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
     * Output: 5
